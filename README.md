RainBot is a work in progress, open-source Discord bot, designed to be fun, flexible and useful yet also able to complete tasks such as having the ability to execute moderation  commands.

# Why should I choose RainBot?
Figuring out which bot you're going to self host can be a tricky task, that's why we believe you should choose us for the following reasons:
## Flexibility
Any command can be easily changed by editing the proper .py file in the `./cogs` directory.
## Growing
RainBot is an open source project currently looking for volunteers to help improve Rainbot. Due to the open source nature of this project, it's easier for us grow overtime and constantly add new features.
## Support
Recieveing support for this bot is a very easy task, just join our Discord server or open a new issue.

# Sounds great! Where do I start?
If you're looking to simply add the bot to your server (and would not like to self host,) you're able to add the bot **[here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=530899015898759199&permissions=8&scope=bot).** Otherwise, follow **[these steps](/github_stuff/tutorial.md)** to host the bot yourself.
