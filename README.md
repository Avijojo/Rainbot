RainBot is a work in progress, open-source Discord bot, designed to be fun, flexible and useful yet also able to complete tasks such as having the ability to execute moderation  commands.

# Why should I choose RainBot?
Figuring out which project your going to self host can always be a tricky task, we believe you should choose us for the following reasons.
## Flexibility
We are very flexible with our commands and they can easily be changed to your liking by simply finding the command you would like to change in the `/cogs` directory.
## Growing
RainBot is an open source project currently looking for volunteers to help make Rainbot special, this helps us grow overtime and constantly add new features.
## Support
Support is very easily able to be provided to yourself or others needing help with our code by simply joining our Discord server or opening an issue on github.

# Sounds great! Where do I start?
If you're looking to simply add the bot to your server, and do not want to self host, you're able to add the bot **[here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=530899015898759199&permissions=8&scope=bot).** Otherwise, follow [these steps](/github_stuff/tutorial.md) on how to self host the bot.
